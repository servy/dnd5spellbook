            You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you
            can see within range to a precise location on a different
            plane of existence. The portal is a circular opening,
            which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can
            orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal
            lasts for the duration.

            </p>
            <p>
            The portal has a front and a back on each plane where
            it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only
            by m oving through its front. Anything that does so is
            instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in
            the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.

            </p>
            <p>
            Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals
            created by this spell from opening in their presence or
            anywhere within their domains.

            </p>
            <p>
            When you cast this spell, you can speak the name
            of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname
            doesn't work). If that creature is on a plane other than
            the one you are on, the portal opens in the named
            creature's immediate vicinity and draws the creature
            through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side
            of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature,
            and it is free to act as the DM deems appropriate. It
            might leave, attack you, or help you.
