            Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water
            inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet
            on a side. You can choose from any of the following
            effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your
            turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a
            different one.

            </p>
            <p>
            Flood. You cause the water level of all standing water in
            the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes
            a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.

            </p>
            <p>
            If you choose an area in a large body of water, you
            instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one
            side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any
            Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried
            with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles
            struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.

            </p>
            <p>
            The water level remains elevated until the spell ends
            or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced
            a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn
            while the flood effect lasts.

            </p>
            <p>
            Part Water. You cause water in the area to move
            apart and create a trench. The trench extends across
            the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to
            either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or
            you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills
            in the trench over the course of the next round until the
            normal water level is restored.

            </p>
            <p>
            Redirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the area
            to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has
            toflow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely
            directions. The water in the area moves as you direct
            it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes
            its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water
            continues to move in the direction you chose until the
            spell ends or you choose a different effect.

            </p>
            <p>
            Whirlpool. This effect requires a body of water
            at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause
            a whirlpool toform in the center of the area. The
            whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet w ide at the
            base, up to 50 feet w ide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any
            creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the
            vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim
            away from the vortex by m aking a Strength (Athletics)
            check against your spell save DC.

            </p>
            <p>
            When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on
            a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength
            saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes <b>2d8</b>
            bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until
            the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes
            half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature
            caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim
            away from the vortex as described above, but has
            disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.

            </p>
            <p>
            The first time each turn that an object enters the
            vortex, the object takes <b>2d8 </b>bludgeoning damage; this
            damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.
