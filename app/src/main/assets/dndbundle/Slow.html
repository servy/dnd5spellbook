            You alter time around up to six creatures of your
            choice in a 40-foot cube within range. Each target must
            succeed on a W isdom saving throw or be affected by
            this spell for the duration.

            </p>
            <p>
            An affected target's speed is halved, it takes a -2
            penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't
            use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or
            a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature's
            abilities or magic items, it can't make more than one
            melee or ranged attack during its turn.

            </p>
            <p>
            If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting
            time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell
            doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the
            creature must use its action on that turn to complete the
            spell. If it can't, the spell is wasted.

            </p>
            <p>
            A creature affected by this spell makes another
            Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn. On a
            successful save, the effect ends for it.
