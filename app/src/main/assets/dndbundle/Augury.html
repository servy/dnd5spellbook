            <p>
            By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones,
            laying out ornate cards, or employing some other
            divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly
            entity about the results of a specific course of action that
            you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The DM
            chooses from the following possible omens:
            • Weal, for good results
            • Woe, for bad results
            • Weal and woe, for both good and bad results
            • Nothing, for results that aren't especially good or bad
            The spell doesn't take into account any possible
            circumstances that might change the outcome, such
            as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain
            of a companion.

            </p>
            <p>
            If you cast the spell two or more times before
            completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25
            percent chance for each casting after the first that you
            get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.
