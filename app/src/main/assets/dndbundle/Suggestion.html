            You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence
            or two) and magically influence a creature you can
            see within range that can hear and understand you.

            </p>
            <p>
            Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this
            effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner
            as to make the course of action sound reasonable.

            </p>
            <p>
            Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto
            a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously
            harmful act ends the spell.

            </p>
            <p>
            The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
            failed save, it pursues the course of action you described
            to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action
            can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested
            activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell
            ends when the subject finishes what it w as asked to do.

            </p>
            <p>
            You can also specify conditions that will trigger a
            special activity during the duration. For example, you
            might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the
            first beggar she meets. If the condition isn't met before
            the spell expires, the activity isn't performed.

            </p>
            <p>
            If you or any of your companions damage the target,
            the spell ends.

            </p>
