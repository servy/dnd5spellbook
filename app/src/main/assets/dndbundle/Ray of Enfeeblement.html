            A black beam of enervating energy springs from your
            finger toward a creature within range. Make a ranged
            spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target deals
            only half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength
            until the spell ends.

            </p>
            <p>
            At the end of each of the target's turns, it can make
            a Constitution saving throw against the spell. On a
            success, the spell ends.
