            You touch a dead creature that has been dead for no
            more than a century, that didn't die of old age, and that
            isn't undead. If its soul is free and willing, the target
            returns to life with all its hit points.

            </p>
            <p>
            This spell neutralizes any p oisons and cures normal
            diseases afflicting the creature when it died. It doesn't,
            however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like;
            if such effects aren't removed prior to casting the spell,
            they afflict the target on its return to life.

            </p>
            <p>
            This spell closes all mortal w ounds and restores any
            missing body parts.

            Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target
            takes a - 4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and
            ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest,
            the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

            </p>
            <p>
            Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has
            been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until
            you finish a long rest, you can't cast spells again, and
            you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks,
            and saving throws.
