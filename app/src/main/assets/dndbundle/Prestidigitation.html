            This spell is a minor m agical trick that novice
            spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the
            following magical effects within range:
            • You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect,
            such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical
            notes, or an odd odor.

            </p>
            <p>
            • You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a
            torch, or a small campfire.

            </p>
            <p>
            • You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger
            than 1 cubic foot.

            </p>
            <p>
            • You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving
            material for 1 hour.

            </p>
            <p>
            • You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear
            on an object or a surface for 1 hour.

            </p>
            <p>
            • You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image
            that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of
            your next turn.

            </p>
            <p>
            If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to
            three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time,
            and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
