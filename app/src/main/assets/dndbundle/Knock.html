            Choose an object that you can see within range. The
            object can be a door, a box, a chest, a set of manacles, a
            padlock, or another object that contains a mundane or
            magical means that prevents access.

            </p>
            <p>
            A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that
            is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or
            unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of
            them is unlocked.

            </p>
            <p>
            If you choose a target that is held shut with arcane
            lock, that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during
            which time the target can be opened and shut normally.

            </p>
            <p>
            When you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as
            far away as 300 feet, emanates from the target object.
