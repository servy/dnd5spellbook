            You imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited
            sentience and animation, giving them the ability
            to communicate with you and follow your simple
            commands. You can question plants about events in the
            spell's area within the past day, gaining information
            about creatures that have passed, weather, and other
            circumstances.

            </p>
            <p>
            You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant
            growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary
            terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn
            ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult
            terrain that lasts for the duration, causing v ines and
            branches to hinder pursuers, for example.

            </p>
            <p>
            Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your
            behalf, at the DM's discretion. The spell doesn't enable
            plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they
            can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.

            </p>
            <p>
            If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate
            with it as if you shared a common language, but you
            gain no magical ability to influence it.

            </p>
            <p>
            This spell can cause the plants created by the entangle
            spell to release a restrained creature.
