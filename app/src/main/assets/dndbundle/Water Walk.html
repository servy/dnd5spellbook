            This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid
            surface—such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand,
            or lava—as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures
            crossing molten lava can still take damage from the
            heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within
            range gain this ability for the duration.

            </p>
            <p>
            If you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the
            spell carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a
            rate of 60 feet per round.
