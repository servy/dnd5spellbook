            You make an area within range magically secure. The
            area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large
            as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration
            or until you use an action to dismiss it.

            </p>
            <p>
            When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of
            security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the
            following properties:
            • Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge of
            the w arded area.

            </p>
            <p>
            • The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy,
            preventing vision (including darkvision) through it.

            </p>
            <p>
            • Sensors created by divination spells can't appear
            inside the protected area or pass through the barrier
            at its perimeter.

            </p>
            <p>
            • Creatures in the area can't be targeted by divination
            spells.

            </p>
            <p>
            • Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.

            </p>
            <p>
            • Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.

            </p>
            <p>
            Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a
            year makes this effect permanent.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size
            of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th.

            </p>
            <p>
            Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet
            on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.
