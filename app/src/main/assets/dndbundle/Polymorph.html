            <p>
            This spell transforms a creature that you can see
            within range into a new form. An unwilling creature
            must make a W isdom saving throw to avoid the
            effect. A shapechanger automatically succeeds on this
            saving throw.

            </p>
            <p>
            The transformation lasts for the duration, or until
            the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form
            can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or
            less than the target's (or the target's level, if it doesn't
            have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics,
            including mental ability scores, are replaced by the
            statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment
            and personality.

            </p>
            <p>
            The target assumes the hit points of its new form.

            </p>
            <p>
            When it reverts to its normal form, the creature
            returns to the number of hit points it had before it
            transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to
            0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its
            normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't
            reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't
            knocked unconscious.

            </p>
            <p>
            The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by
            the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells,
            or take any other action that requires hands or speech.

            </p>
            <p>
            The target's gear melds into the new form. The
            creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit
            from any of its equipment.

            </p>
