            You create a sound or an image of an object within
            range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if
            you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.

            </p>
            <p>
            If you create a sound, its volume can range from a
            whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone
            else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any
            other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated
            throughout the duration, or you can make discrete
            sounds at different times before the spell ends.

            </p>
            <p>
            If you create an image of an object—such as a chair,
            muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger
            than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create sound, light,
            smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction
            with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because
            things can pass through it.

            </p>
            <p>
            If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or
            image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion
            with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check
            against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the
            illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to
            the creature.
