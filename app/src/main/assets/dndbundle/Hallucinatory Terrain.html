            You make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range
            look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural
            terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to
            resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult
            or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem
            like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope,
            or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.

            Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures
            within the area aren't changed in appearance.

            The tactile characteristics of the terrain are
            unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to
            see through the illusion. If the difference isn't obvious
            by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can
            attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against
            your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who
            discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague
            image superimposed on the terrain.
