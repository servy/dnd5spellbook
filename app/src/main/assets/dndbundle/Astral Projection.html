            You and up to eight willing creatures within range
            project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the
            spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already
            on that plane). The material body you leave behind is
            unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it
            doesn't need food or air and doesn't age.

            </p>
            <p>
            Your astral body resembles your m ortal form in
            almost every way, replicating your game statistics and
            possessions. The principal difference is the addition of
            a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder
            blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after
            1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As
            long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way
            home. If the cord is cut—something that can happen
            only when an effect specifically states that it does—your
            soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.

            </p>
            <p>
            Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral
            Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any
            other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the
            plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and
            possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing
            you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane.

            </p>
            <p>
            Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage
            or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your
            physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.

            </p>
            <p>
            The spell ends for you and your companions when
            you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends,
            the affected creature returns to its physical body,
            and it awakens.

            </p>
            <p>
            The spell might also end early for you or one of your
            companions. A successful dispel magic spell used
            against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that
            creature. If a creature's original body or its astral form
            drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If
            the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls
            the creature's astral form back to its body, ending its
            state of suspended animation.

            </p>
            <p>
            If you are returned to your body prematurely, your
            companions remain in their astral forms and must find
            their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping
            to 0 hit points.
