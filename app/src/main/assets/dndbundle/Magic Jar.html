            <p>
            Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves
            it and enters the container you used for the spell's
            material component. While your soul inhabits the
            container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you
            were in the container's space. You can't move or use
            reactions. The only action you can take is to project your
            soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning
            to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting
            to pos sess a humanoids body.

            </p>
            <p>
            You can attempt to pos sess any humanoid within
            100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a
            protection from evil and good or magic circle spell can't
            be possessed). The target must make a Charisma saving
            throw. On a failure, your soul moves into the target's
            body, and the target's soul becomes trapped in the
            container. On a success, the target resists your efforts
            to pos sess it, and you can't attempt to pos sess it again
            for 24 hours.

            </p>
            <p>
            Once you pos sess a creature's body, you control it.

            </p>
            <p>
            Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the
            creature, though you retain your alignment and your
            Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain
            the benefit of your own class features. If the target has
            any class levels, you can't use any of its class features.

            </p>
            <p>
            Meanwhile, the possessed creature's soul can
            perceive from the container using its own senses, but it
            can't move or take actions at all.

            </p>
            <p>
            While possessing a body, you can use your action to
            return from the host body to the container if it is within
            100 feet of you, returning the host creature's soul to
            its body. If the host body dies while you're in it, the
            creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving
            throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a success,
            you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you.

            </p>
            <p>
            Otherwise, you die.

            </p>
            <p>
            If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your
            soul immediately returns to your body. If your body is
            more than 100 feet away from you or if your body is
            dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. If another
            creature's soul is in the container when it is destroyed,
            the creature's soul returns to its body if the body is alive
            and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies.

            </p>
            <p>
            When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.
