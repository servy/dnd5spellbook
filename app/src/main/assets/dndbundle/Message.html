            <p>
            You point your finger toward a creature within range
            and whisper a message. The target (and only the target)
            hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only
            you can hear.

            You can cast this spell through solid objects if you
            are familiar with the target and know it is beyond
            the barrier. Magical silence. 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of
            common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood
            blocks the spell. The spell doesn't have tofollow a
            straight line and can travel freely around corners or
            through openings.
