            You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for
            the duration. The copy can appear at any location
            within range that you have seen before, regardless of
            intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds
            like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any
            damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.

            You can use your action to move this illusion up to
            twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and
            behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your
            mannerisms perfectly.

            You can see through its eyes and hear through its
            ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus
            action, you can switch from using its senses to using
            your own, or back again. While you are using its senses,
            you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own
            surroundings.

            Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an
            illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature
            that uses its action to examine the image can determine
            that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence
            (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a
            creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature
            can see through the image, and any noise it makes
            sounds hollow to the creature.
