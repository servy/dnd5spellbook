            You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each
            dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see
            within range. A dart deals <b>1d4 + 1</b> force damage to its
            target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can
            direct them to hit one creature or several.

            </p>

            spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates one
            more dart for each slot level above 1st.
