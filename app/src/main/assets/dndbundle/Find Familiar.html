            You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an
            animal form you choose: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk,
            lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper),
            rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or w easel. Appearing in
            an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the
            statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey,
            or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.

            </p>
            <p>
            Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always
            obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own
            initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't
            attack, but it can take other actions as normal.

            </p>
            <p>
            When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears,
            leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you
            cast this spell again
            While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you
            can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally,
            as an action, you can see through your familiar's eyes
            and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn,
            gaining the benefits of any special senses that the
            familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind
            with regard to your own senses.

            </p>
            <p>
            As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your
            familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it
            awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it
            forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed,
            you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space
            within 30 feet of you.

            </p>
            <p>
            You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you
            cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you
            instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the
            forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into
            the chosen creature.

            </p>
            <p>
            Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch,
            your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the
            spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and
            it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast
            it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack
            modifier for the roll.
