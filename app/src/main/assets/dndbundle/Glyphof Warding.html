            <p>
            When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that
            harms other creatures, either upon a surface (such as
            a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object
            that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure
            chest) to conceal the glyph. If you choose a surface, the
            glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than
            10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object
            must remain in its place; if the object is moved more
            than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is
            broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.

            </p>
            <p>
            The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful
            Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save
            DC to be found.

            </p>
            <p>
            You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast
            the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most
            typical triggers include touching or standing on the
            glyph, removing another object covering the glyph,
            approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or
            manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed.

            </p>
            <p>
            For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common
            triggers include opening that object, approaching within
            a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the
            glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.

            </p>
            <p>
            You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates
            only under certain circumstances or according to
            physical characteristics (such as height or weight),
            creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to
            affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also
            set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph,
            such as those w ho say a certain password.

            </p>
            <p>
            When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes
            or a spell glyph.

            </p>
            <p>
            Explosive Runes. When triggered, the glyph erupts
            with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered
            on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each
            creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving
            throw. A creature takes <b>5d8 </b>acid, cold, fire, lightning, or
            thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice
            when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a
            successful one.

            </p>
            <p>
            Spell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of
            3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part
            of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single
            creature or an area. The spell being stored has no
            immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph
            is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a
            target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph.

            </p>
            <p>
            If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on
            that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures
            or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as
            close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the
            spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its
            full duration.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
            a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an
            explosive runes glyph increases by <b>1d8 </b>for each slot
            level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store
            any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for
            the glyph of warding.
