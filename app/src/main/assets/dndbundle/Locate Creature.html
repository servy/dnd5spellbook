            Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You
            sense the direction to the creature's location, as long as
            that creature is within 1,000 feet of you. If the creature
            is moving, you know the direction of its movement.

            </p>
            <p>
            The spell can locate a specific creature known to
            you, or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as
            a human or a unicorn), so long as you have seen such a
            creature up close—within 30 feet—at least once. If the
            creature you described or named is in a different form,
            such as being under the effects of a polymorph spell,
            this spell doesn't locate the creature.

            </p>
            <p>
            This spell can't locate a creature if running water at
            least 10 feet w ide blocks a direct path between you and
            the creature.
