            You conjure a phantom watchdog in an unoccupied
            space that you can see within range, where it remains
            for the duration, until you dismiss it as an action, or until
            you move more than 100 feet away from it.

            </p>
            <p>
            The hound is invisible to all creatures except you
            and can't be harmed. When a Small or larger creature
            comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking the
            password that you specify when you cast this spell, the
            hound starts barking loudly. The hound sees invisible
            creatures and can see into the Ethereal Plane. It
            ignores illusions.

            </p>
            <p>
            At the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts
            to bite one creature within 5 feet of it that is hostile
            to you. The hound's attack bonus is equal to your
            spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.

            </p>
            <p>
            On a hit, it deals <b>4d8 </b>piercing damage.
