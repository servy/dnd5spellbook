            You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a
            creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack
            against the creature to assail it with the chill of the
            grave. On a hit, the target takes <b>1d8 </b>necrotic damage,
            and it can't regain hit points until the start of your next
            turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target.

            </p>
            <p>
            If you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on
            attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn.

            </p>

            This spell's damage increases by <b>1d8 </b>when you reach
            5th level (<b>2d8</b>), 11th level (<b>3d8</b>), and 17th level (<b>4d8</b>).
