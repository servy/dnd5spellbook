            <p>
            A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence
            at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches
            thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels.

            </p>
            <p>
            Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other
            panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot
            panels that are only 3 inches thick.

            </p>
            <p>
            If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it
            appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall
            (your choice). If a creature w ould be surrounded on all
            sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface),
            that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a
            success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so
            that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.

            </p>
            <p>
            The wall can have any shape you desire, though it
            can't occupy the same space as a creature or object.

            </p>
            <p>
            The wall doesn't need to be vertical or rest on any firm
            foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly
            supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell
            to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.

            </p>
            <p>
            If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you
            must halve the size of each panel to create supports.

            </p>
            <p>
            You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations,
            battlements, and so on.

            </p>
            <p>
            The wall is an object made of stone that can be
            damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and
            30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel
            to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected
            panels to collapse at the DM's discretion.

            </p>
            <p>
            If you maintain your concentration on this spell for
            its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and
            can't be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when
            the spell ends.
