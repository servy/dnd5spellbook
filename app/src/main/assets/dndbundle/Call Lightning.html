            A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that
            is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point
            you can see 100 feet directly above you. The spell fails
            if you can't see a point in the air where the storm cloud
            could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can't
            accommodate the cloud).

            </p>
            <p>
            When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see
            within range. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the
            cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that
            point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature
            takes <b>3d10 </b>lightning damage on a failed save, or half
            as much damage on a successful one. On each of your
            turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call
            down lightning in this way again, targeting the same
            point or a different one.

            </p>

            If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you
            cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the
            existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under
            such conditions, the spell's damage increases by <b>1d10</b>.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by
            <b>1d10 </b>for each slot level above 3rd.
