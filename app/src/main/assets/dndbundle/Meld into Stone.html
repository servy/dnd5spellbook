            You step into a stone object or surface large enough to
            fully contain your body, melding yourself and all the
            equipment you carry with the stone for the duration.

            </p>
            <p>
            Using your movement, you step into the stone at a point
            you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible
            or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.

            </p>
            <p>
            While merged with the stone, you can't see what
            occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks
            you make to hear sounds outside it are made with
            disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of
            time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in
            the stone. You can use your movement to leave the
            stone where you entered it, which ends the spell. You
            otherwise can't move.

            </p>
            <p>
            Minor physical damage to the stone doesn't harm
            you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape
            (to the extent that you no longer fit w ithin it) expels you
            and deals <b>6d6 </b>bludgeoning damage to you. The stone's
            complete destruction (or transmutation into a different
            substance) expels you and deals 50 bludgeoning damage
            to you. If expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space
            closest to where you first entered.
