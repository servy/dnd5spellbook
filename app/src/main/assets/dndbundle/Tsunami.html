            A wall of water springs into existence at a point you
            choose within range. You can make the wall up to 300
            feet long, 300 feet high, and 50 feet thick. The wall lasts
            for the duration.

            </p>
            <p>
            When the wall appears, each creature within its area
            must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save,
            a creature takes 6 d10 bludgeoning damage, or half as
            much damage on a successful save.

            </p>
            <p>
            At the start of each of your turns after the wall
            appears, the wall, along with any creatures in it, moves
            50 feet away from you. Any Huge or smaller creature
            inside the wall or whose space the wall enters when
            it moves must succeed on a Strength saving throw or
            take 5 d10 bludgeoning damage. A creature can take
            this damage only once per round. At the end of the turn,
            the wall's height is reduced by 50 feet, and the damage
            creatures take from the spell on subsequent rounds is
            reduced by <b>1d10</b>. When the wall reaches 0 feet in height,
            the spell ends.

            </p>
            <p>
            A creature caught in the wall can move by swimming.

            </p>
            <p>
            Because of the force of the wave, though, the creature
            must make a successful Strength (Athletics) check
            against your spell save DC in order to move at all. If it
            fails the check, it can't move. A creature that moves out
            of the area falls to the ground.
