            <p>
            You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet
            of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred
            5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The
            warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you
            desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by
            dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk
            into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.

            </p>
            <p>
            When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals
            that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that
            you choose. You can also specify a password that,
            when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to
            these effects.

            </p>
            <p>
            Guards and wards creates the following effects within
            the warded area.

            </p>
            <p>
            Corridors. Fog fills all the warded corridors, making
            them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection
            or branching passage offering a choice of direction,
            there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than
            you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from
            the one it chooses.

            </p>
            <p>
            Doors. All doors in the w arded area are magically
            locked, as if sealed by an arcane lock spell. In addition,
            you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent
            to the illusory object function of the minor illusion spell)
            to make them appear as plain sections of wall.

            </p>
            <p>
            Stairs. Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top
            to bottom, as the web spell. These strands regrow in 10
            minutes if they are burned or torn away while guards
            and wards lasts.

            </p>
            <p>
            Other Spell Effect. You can place your choice of one
            of the following magical effects within the w arded area
            of the stronghold.

            </p>
            <p>
            • Place dancing lights in four corridors. You can designate
            a simple program that the lights repeat as long as
            guards and wards lasts.

            </p>
            <p>
            • Place magic mouth in two locations.

            </p>
            <p>
            • Place stinking cloud in two locations. The vapors
            appear in the places you designate; they return within
            10 minutes if dispersed by w ind while guards and
            wards lasts.

            </p>
            <p>
            • Place a constant gust of wind in one corridor or room.

            </p>
            <p>
            • Place a suggestion in one location. You select an area
            of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters
            or passes through the area receives the suggestion
            mentally.

            </p>
            <p>
            The whole w arded area radiates magic. A dispel
            magic cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes
            only that effect.

            </p>
            <p>
            You can create a permanently guarded and warded
            structure by casting this spell there every day
            for one year.
