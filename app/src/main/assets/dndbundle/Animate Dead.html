            This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile
            of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid
            within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul
            mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The
            target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a
            zombie if you chose a corpse (the DM has the creature's
            game statistics).

            </p>
            <p>
            On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action
            to mentally command any creature you made with
            this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you
            control multiple creatures, you can command any or all
            of them at the same time, issuing the same command to
            each one). You decide what action the creature will take
            and where it w ill move during its next turn, or you can
            issue a general command, such as to guard a particular
            chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the
            creature only defends itself against hostile creatures.

            </p>
            <p>
            Once given an order, the creature continues tofollow it
            until its task is complete.

            </p>
            <p>
            The creature is under your control for 24 hours,
            after which it stops obeying any command you've given
            it. To maintain control of the creature for another
            24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature
            again before the current 24-hour period ends. This
            use of the spell reasserts your control over up tofour
            creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than
            animating a new one.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert
            control over two additional undead creatures for each
            slot level above 3rd. Each of the creatures must come
            from a different corpse or pile of bones.
