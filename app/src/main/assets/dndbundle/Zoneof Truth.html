            You create a magical zone that guards against deception
            in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your
            choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature
            that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn
            or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving
            throw. On a failed save, a creature can't speak a
            deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether
            each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.

            </p>

            An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus
            avoid answering questions to which it would normally
            respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in
            its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries
