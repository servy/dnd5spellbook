            You and up tofive w illing creatures within 5 feet of you
            instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary.

            </p>
            <p>
            You and any creatures that teleport with you appear in
            the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated
            when you prepared your sanctuary (see below). If you
            cast this spell without first preparing a sanctuary, the
            spell has no effect.

            </p>
            <p>
            You must designate a sanctuary by casting this spell
            within a location, such as a temple, dedicated to or
            strongly linked to your deity. If you attempt to cast the
            spell in this manner in an area that isn't dedicated to
            your deity, the spell has no effect.
