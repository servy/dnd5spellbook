            You attempt to beguile a beast that you can see within
            range. It must succeed on a W isdom saving throw or be
            charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that
            are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the
            saving throw.

            </p>
            <p>
            While the beast is charmed, you have a telepathic link
            with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane
            of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue
            commands to the creature while you are conscious (no
            action required), which it does its best to obey. You can
            specify a simple and general course of action, such as
            “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that
            object.” If the creature completes the order and doesn't
            receive further direction from you, it defends and
            preserves itself to the best of its ability.

            </p>
            <p>
            You can u se your action to take total and precise
            control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the
            creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't
            do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this
            time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction,
            but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

            </p>
            <p>
            Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new
            Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving
            throw succeeds, the spell ends.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell with a
            5th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up
            to 10 minutes. When you use a 6th-level spell slot,
            the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you
            use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is
            concentration, up to 8 hours.
