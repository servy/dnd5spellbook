            Purifying energy radiates from you in an aura with a
            30-foot radius. Until the spell ends, the aura moves
            with you, centered on you. Each nonhostile creature
            in the aura (including you) can't become diseased,
            has resistance to poison damage, and has advantage
            on saving throws against effects that cause any of the
            following conditions: blinded, charmed, deafened,
            frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, and stunned.
