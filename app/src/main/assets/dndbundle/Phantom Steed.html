            A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on
            the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice
            within range. You decide the creature's appearance,
            but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any
            of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a
            puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away
            from the steed.

            </p>
            <p>
            For the duration, you or a creature you choose can
            ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a
            riding horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can
            travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace.

            </p>
            <p>
            When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving
            the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use
            an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.
