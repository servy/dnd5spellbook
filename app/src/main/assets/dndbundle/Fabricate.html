            You convert raw materials into products of the same
            material. For example, you can fabricate a wooden
            bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a patch of
            hemp, and clothes from flax or wool.

            </p>
            <p>
            Choose raw materials that you can see within range.

            </p>
            <p>
            You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained
            within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes),
            given a sufficient quantity of raw material. If you
            are working with metal, stone, or another mineral
            substance, however, the fabricated object can be no
            larger than Medium (contained within a single 5-foot
            cube). The quality of objects made by the spell is
            commensurate with the quality of the raw materials.

            </p>

            Creatures or magic items can't be created or
            transmuted by this spell. You also can't use it to
            create items that ordinarily require a high degree of
            craftsmanship, such as jewelry, weapons, glass, or
            armor, unless you have proficiency with the type of
            artisan's tools used to craft such objects.
