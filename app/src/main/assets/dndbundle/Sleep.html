        This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber.
        Roll <b>5d8</b>; the total is how many hit points of creatures
        this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of
        a point you choose within range are affected in
        ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring
        unconscious creatures).
        </p>
        <p>
        Starting with the creature that has the lowest current
        hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls
        unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes
        damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the
        sleeper awake. Subtract each creature's hit points from
        the total before moving on to the creature with the next
        lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be equal
        to or less than the remaining total for that creature
        to be affected.
        </p>
        <p>
        Undead and creatures immune to being charmed
        aren't affected by this spell.
        </p>
        <p>
        At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
        spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional <b>2d8</b> for
        each slot level above 1st.
