            A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a
            target that you can see within range. The target can be a
            creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such
            as the wall created by wall of force.

            </p>
            <p>
            A creature targeted by this spell must make a
            Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes
            <b>10d6 + 40</b> force damage. If this damage reduces the
            target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.

            </p>
            <p>
            A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing
            and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile
            of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life
            only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell.

            </p>
            <p>
            This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or
            smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical
            force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation
            of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of
            it. A m agic item is unaffected by this spell.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by
            <b>3d6 </b>for each slot level above 6th.
